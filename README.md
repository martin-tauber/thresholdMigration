# TrueSight Threshold Migration
The threshold migration utiltiy migrates instance thresholds exported from the TrueSight Presentation Server to policies.

# Prerequisites
This script is written in python using version 3.x. You need to run this script on a machine where python 3.x is installed.
You also need to make sure that you have the following python modules installed:

* xml
* json
* shlex
* uuid
* codecs
* pandas
* itertools

If you are using a standard python installation, then use 

    python -m pip install <packagename>

to install the missing package. If you are using anacoda then use

    pip install <packagename>

to install the missing packages.

# Installation
You just need to clone this repository onto your machine using

    git clone https://github.com/martin-tauber/thresholdMigration.git 

The python script is independent of the operating system. So you can install it on any operating system where python is runnning.
It is also independent of the truesight installation, which means you don't need to have a truesight installation or any components
of it running on the machine where you are running this script. The script will generate json files which contain policy definitions.
These files then can be transfered to a machine where you can import them into TrueSight using the cmamigration utility deployed
with the truesight installation.

If you don't have git installed on your machine and you don't want to install git, go to the website
https://github.com/martin-tauber/thresholdMigration.git click on the *code* button and choose download zip from the pulldown menu.
Extract the file in a directory of you choice and you are all set.

# Migrating Thresholds
## Export the thresholds from the Truesight Presentation server

To migrate thresholds you first need to export the thresholds you want to migrate using the export utility provided by TrueSight. See ???
for more information about how to export the thresholds from truesight. You can the unzip the file in your prefered directory in the
machine where you want to run the script.

## Running the tool

To migrate thresholds run the following command

    ./cmautil.py migrate --thresholds <path>

where *path* is the path to the file you exported from the TrueSight presentation server. The *path* parameter can point to a file or a 
directory. If it points to a directory all the files in the directory are migrated. You can also specify more than one *path* following
the --thresholds switch. The all the files and directories specified will be migrated.

## Understanding the output

The migration utility will generate policy and agent configuration files. These files by default are located in the out/policies and 
out/tags directory. You can override the default directory for the output with the following command line options:

    --policydir <path>
    --tagsdir <path>

The *--policydir* specifies where the generated policies should be stored. Then *--tagsdir* specifies were the configuration files containing
the agent tags are stored.

The primary goal of the tool is to create monitoring policies that can be imported into the TrueSight presentation server. These 
policies will be stored in the out/policies directory. The tool has a build in optimizer component which will generate two types of policies.
The first type is the 'BASE' policy. BASE policies are created by finding the biggest set of equal thresholds for one monitor type.
BASE policies will be applied to all the agents which run that configuration. For every agent which runs a BASE policy a configuration
file is generated in the tags directory. The configuraion file will contain all the tags for that agent. The file is in pconfig format to
make it easier to distrubute the configuration to the agents. Base policies will have a prefix "BASE-".

    PATROL_CONFIG
    "/AgentSetup/Identification/Tags/TAG/BASE-NT_MEMORY‚Äù = { REPLACE = "Auto generated tag" }

The second type of policy which is generated in the agent policy. The agent policy will contain all the configurations. which are not covered
by a base policy. Agent policies will be named by the agent and port number.

## Setting policy defaults

The tool generates policies and makes certain assumptions about default values. For example it assumes that the tenant id is "*". You can override
these assumptions from the command line. (use ./cmautil.py migrate -h to get more details and the values that are set my default). The following
defaults can be overwritten using the command line:

    --tenantid <tenantid>
    --tenantname <tenantname>
    --owner <owner>
    --group <group>
    --shared
    --enabled

The *--shared* and the *--enabled* flag will set the policies created to be shared and enabled. If these flags are not specified the generated
policies will not be shared and be disabled.

You can also specify the precedence of the policies being generated. As we are creating two types of policies (base and agent policies) you can
specify the precedence from the command line:

    --baseprecedence
    --agentprecedence

you don't need to speciy the full switch name as long as the part you typed is unique. So you can for example type --base instead of --baseprecedence

## Understanding the optimizer

The optimizer tries to find communalities in policy configurations. For the threshold configuration it is going to find threshold configurations 
which are equal and the agents which these thresholds apply to. It will then find the largest set of agent/configuration combinations and define
this as the base. From the base, the base policies are then generated. The policy generator will then check every agent to see if it's cvonfiguration
is covered by the base policies. If they are covered a file for this agent is generated in the tags directory and the Tag for the policy is added.
If the configurations for the agent are not covered an agent policy is generated. The agent policy will directly address the agent in the agent 
selection criteria of the policy.

To measure the quality of the base policies created the optimzer uses the *coverage*. The coverage is the percentage of agent/configuration combinations covered by the policy compared to the overall agent/configuration combinations. By default a coverage larger than 20% is considered to
be a good coverage. If the coverage of a base policy is not good, it is going to be ignored.

You can use the following command line option to change the threshold percentage for good policies. 

    --optimizethreshold <percent>

To prevent generating base policies that have a good coverage but are applied only to a very small amount of agents, the following command line
option can be used:

    --minagents <numberOfAgents>

With this command line option you specify the minimum number of agents a base policy must cover. If it is less the base policy is ignored.

### Grouping

Base policies are generated for a subset of agent/configuration combinations. The opimizer therefor generats the configuration matrix. Imagine
the configuration matrix as a matrix having the agents as columns and the configurations as rows. Every cell of that matrix contains a boolean
indicating if that configuration is applied to the corresponding agent or not. This matrix is cut into pieces and for every piece the optimizer 
finds the optimal agent/configuration combination for generating the base policy.

### Horizontal Split - Configuration Grouping

Horizontally the matrix is split into configurations of the same monitor type. So for example the optimizer will try to find base policies for
DISKS and another base policy for CPU. Currently there is no configuration parameter to influence the horizontal split.

### Vertical Split - Agent Grouping

Horizontally the agents can be split dependent on agent attribute. For example agents could be split into the agents belonging to the production
environment and agent belonging to the test environment. The grouping helps the optimizer to find meaningful base policies. The agent attributes
are controlled via the agent info file. The agent info file is a csv file containing the host name in the first column and any attribute in the 
following colums.

Example

    Host,Customer,Environment
    asterix,Pepsi,Production
    obelix,Pepsi,Production
    idefix,Coke,Test

As mentioned you can specify any column after the the first column. Normally you would generate the agent info file from the CMDB or any CMDB like
source.

The optimizer will them gemerate policies for all combinations it finds in that file. So for the example above the optimizer tries to generate the
BASE-Pepsi policy, the BASE-Pepsi-Production polica, the BASE-Coke policy and the BASE-Coke-Production policy. Keep in mind that these policies are
on generated if the optimizer considers the policies to have a good coverage (--optimizethreshold) and the number of agents this policy is applied 
to is bigger than --minagents.

The agent info file can be specified from the command line using:

    --agentinfo <path>


If no agent info file is specified, no horizontal split will be done. 

Be aware that the optimizer will generate policies as a combination of the Horizontal split and the vertical split. As mentioned for every piece of
the split it tries to find the optimal policy. So combining the two examples above the optimizer would generate policies like BASE-Pepsi-Production-CPU

For more information about the optimizer take a look at the presentation in the docs folder.

## Jobs

The tool is designed to make the best assumptions for you trying to avoid the need of specifying specific options from the command line. Nevertheless
it might get unconfortable to specify your overrides every time you invoke the utility. Therfor you can create jobs. A job can easily be created by specifying the command line option *--save filename*.

Example

    ./cmautil.py --save job1.mig migrate --thresholds mythresholds.csv --optimizethreshold 40 --agentinfo myagentinfo.csv

you then can either directly run the job by specifying

    ./cmautil.py --load job1.mig

which would run exactly the command shown in the example above. You can also load the job and override specific values by specifying the *migrate*
command after the *--load* option and overriding any command line parameter.

    ./cmautil.py --load job1.mig migrate --optimize 30

The above command would load the configuration from the job1.mig file and override the --optimizethreshold option. In the example the --optimze is not a typo. Since the command line option is unique by just typing that part you don't need to type the full command line option.

## Repositories

To generate policies the policy generator needs to merge meta data found in the repository like the release and the solution name. The tool comes
with cashed versions of the BMC repository. By default the tool will alway choose the latest version of the repository found in the cache. You can 
override this behaviour by specifing the

    --version <version>

The tool will then look for the specified version in the cache. You can also override the directory were the tool will expect the cache with the

    --cachedir <path>

option.
